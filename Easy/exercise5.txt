You have been tasked with writing a function that takes in a list of integers and returns the largest number in the list.

Write a function named "find_largest_number" that takes one parameter: a list of integers. The function should iterate over the list, keeping track of the largest number seen so far. Once all the numbers have been checked, return the largest number.

Here's some sample input and output to help you test your function:

Input:
find_largest_number([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
Output:
6

Input:
find_largest_number([10, 20, 30, 40])
Output:
40

Input:
find_largest_number([-5, -3, -10, -1])
Output:
-1

Good luck!
