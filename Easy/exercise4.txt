You have been tasked with writing a function that takes in two strings and returns True if the second string is a substring of the first string, and False otherwise.

Write a function named "is_substring" that takes two parameters: string1 and string2. The function should check if string2 is a substring of string1 and return True if it is, False otherwise.

Here's some sample input and output to help you test your function:

Input:
is_substring("hello world", "world")
Output:
True

Input:
is_substring("python is fun", "java")
Output:
False

Input:
is_substring("racecar", "car")
Output:
True

Good luck!
