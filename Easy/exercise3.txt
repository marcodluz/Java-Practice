You have been tasked with writing a function that takes in a string and returns the string in reverse order.

Write a function named "reverse_string" that takes one parameter: a string. The function should create a new string that is the reverse of the input string and return it.

Here's some sample input and output to help you test your function:

Input:
reverse_string("hello")
Output:
"olleh"

Input:
reverse_string("python")
Output:
"nohtyp"

Input:
reverse_string("racecar")
Output:
"racecar"

Good luck!
