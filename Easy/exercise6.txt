You have been tasked with writing a function that takes in two strings and returns a new string that concatenates the two input strings, with a space in between.

Write a function named "concatenate_strings" that takes two parameters: string1 and string2. The function should concatenate the two input strings with a space in between, and return the resulting string.

Here's some sample input and output to help you test your function:

Input:
concatenate_strings("hello", "world")
Output:
"hello world"

Input:
concatenate_strings("python", "is fun")
Output:
"python is fun"

Input:
concatenate_strings("racecar", "driver")
Output:
"racecar driver"

Good luck!
