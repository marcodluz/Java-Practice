You have been tasked with writing a function that takes in a list of integers and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the list.

Write a function named "sum_even_numbers" that takes one parameter: a list of integers. The function should iterate over the list, checking each number to see if it is even. If the number is even, add it to a running total. Once all the numbers have been checked, return the running total.

Here's some sample input and output to help you test your function:

Input:
sum_even_numbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
Output:
12

Input:
sum_even_numbers([10, 20, 30, 40])
Output:
100

Input:
sum_even_numbers([1, 3, 5])
Output:
0

Good luck!
